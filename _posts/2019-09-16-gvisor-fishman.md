# The BackGround of the resource of Gvisor

## Two Important Weaknesses of Tranditional Container 

- The tranditional Linux containers are not safe enough, because when run apps on the containers, actually kernel exposes very large easy-attacked areas although linux limits some resources when interacting with apps(the limited ones can also be attacked by some ways).

- It's difficult to know the system calls between apps and kernel while using tranditional container, which mean we are difficult to determine the whitelist of system calls.

## The Solutions

- If we want to improve isolation between host kernel and apps we can increase two floors between apps and host kernel: guest kernel and vm; While in this way we still need a lot resource footprint. ** Kata containers ** is an open-source project in this way.

- gvisor is more lightweight than a vm and just like vm distinct from the host and other sandboxes. It can change resources over the time not like vm requires a fixed set of resources.

## install

[You can install gvisor by steps here](https://gvisor.dev/docs/user_guide/docker/#install-gvisor)

- When installing, you may find the terminal exit cause 'set -e'. For me, it's due to 'sha512sum -c runsc.sha512'. I think there maybe some changes on runsc but the runsc.sha512 stays the same.

- When inputing 'Docker run hello-world', you may find the warning following.

   you can use these codes to avoid adding sudo each time.
	    
```shell
 sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
 sudo chmod 666 /vsr/run/docker.sock
```
